This is all my week one work for App Academy!

I'm just going back and updating all my work and fixing it up to look nice, so far all you should see is day one.

I'm actually a big fan of how I refactored Towers of Hannoi to be classed based and refactored 15_in_words from test first ruby so that it doesn't suck.
